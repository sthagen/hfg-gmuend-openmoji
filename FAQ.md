<details>
<summary>
ü§î: Does the OpenMoji project have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA)?
</summary>

No. OpenMoji does not have an explicit Contributor License Agreement. We simply go with common practice of many open source projects: "inbound = outbound"! Every Github user already agrees to this via the [terms of service](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service#6-contributions-under-repository-license) of Github:

> Whenever you make a contribution to a repository containing notice of a license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms.

<details>
<summary>
ü§î: I suggested / proposed / asked for an Emoji ... but why is my name not listed as "author" of the new OpenMoji?
</summary>

Because we decided that the authorship should go to the person who took actively care of everything in terms of making: sketching, designing, testing, iterating, discussing etc. until the new OpenMoji was accepted. Ideally the same person takes care of the entire pipeline from start to end. However if the initial suggestion was by a different person, we will acknowledge this in the `changelog.txt` file while still crediting the "maker" as the author.

## Technical problems

<details>
<summary>
ü§î: The OpenMoji Black or Colorfont is not working as expected ... is this me?

‚ö†Ô∏è The colorfont version of OpenMoji is in a very early alpha stage and not intended to use in production! Please follow the [discussion](https://github.com/hfg-gmuend/openmoji/issues/93) for updates.
